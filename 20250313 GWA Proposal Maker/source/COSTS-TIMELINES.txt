Phase 1
	- 2 weeks & €1150. This will involve...
	- 1 intel workshop on what & why is an investor syndicate & raise targets, an investor story & an inevitability audit.
	- A series of interactive dat collecting tools to collect the team's views
	- A workshop to discuss & critique the draft summary report on these
	- An amended final report that incorporates the feedback from the previously mentioned workshop, and details the gaps & needed work to become investment ready.


Phase 2
	- It is difficult to accurately predict what costs and times will be involved here as this phase is generally aimed at the gaps identified in Phase 1. 
	- As a guide, it is typically ~€1295 per issue identified. Each follows a similar footprint of the process detailed in Phase 1. Each requires ~2 weeks to complete. And generally there are between 1-3 issues identified to focus on.

Phase 3
	- This may take many different focus points. But generally here is when the engagement moves from a Contractor engagement (as with Phase 1 & 2) to a regular employee engagement. This is typically a fraction engagement 1-2 days per week & the salary is typically offset with equity. At this stage it is not possible to reasonably estimate these costs or to justify this need. This will become possible as we move through Phase 2.
